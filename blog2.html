        <h2>Quantum Supremacy and Advantage </h2>
      <p>
        In complexity classes, P(Polynomial time) is all the problems that
         classical computers can solve quickly, and NP(Nondeterministic Polynomia
         l time) is all the problems that classical computers can't necessarily solve,
         ierarchy) is the generalization of NP, which means it contains all the problems
          which when NP problem is added with more complexity. Classical computers can't
           solve most of the PH problems. A new class called BQP (Bounded error quantum
            polynomial time) was defined to contain all the problems, that a quantum computer can solve efficiently. It is also proved that quantum computers can solve all the problems that are in P, which classical computers can also solve. Still, it is not known what set of problems belong to BQP. However, it is known that all the problems solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer. 
Quantum computers of significant size are not available at the present moment, so we
 need to identify a practical problem that is beyond the reach of classical computers
  with the fewest resources possible.

      <h2>Quantum Supremacy and Advantage </h2>
      <p>
        Quantum advantage is when quantum computers can perform a 
        task done by a classical computer, hundreds or thousands of 
        times faster. Whereas, Supremacy refers to the quantum computer 
        being so powerful that it can perform computations that are impossible 
        to achieve with a classic computer within a definable amount of time. 
      </p>

      <h3>
        Sycamore
      </h3>
      <p>
        Google AI quantum has experimented with quantum supremacy by building a
         54- qubit processor, called "Sycamore". In benchmark testing, this qubit processor 
         could complete the computation in 200 seconds, whereas it would take 10,000 years for 
         the world's fastest supercomputer to produce the same output. Sycamore comprises of the 2D grid, 
         where each qubit is connected to four others. This increases connectivity for faster interaction 
         and enhanced parallelism. One of the main quantum applications in quantum randomness, testing
          is still ongoing to implement it in a prototype. 

      </p>
      <h2>Quantum Annealing</h2>
      <p>
        It is a metaheuristic, which means it is a technique designed to solve problems
         more quickly when classic methods are too slow. It is for finding the global
          minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions by 
          a process using quantum fluctuations. It is mainly used for problems where the 
          search space is discrete. 
    </p>
    <h2>Quantum decoherence </h2>
    <p>
        One of the greatest challenges is isolating quantum computers from their environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. Decoherence includes quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement qubits. Decoherence is irreversible. 
This corrupts the superposition state of qubits if kept for a long duration of time. Hence, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable. 

    </p>
    <h2>Quantum Teleportation</h2>
    <p>
        We cannot copy a qubit state and send it, because we can only copy classical states (not superpositions). But we can teleport from one end to another using entangles qubit pair (Bell pair), but the sender won't have that state anymore. This means, the qubit state, and one end is destroyed to recreate it on another qubit. 
    </p>
    <h3>Superdense-coding</h3>
    <p>
        It is also passing data, but it is different from Quantum teleportation. Here, we transmit two classical bits using one qubit. 
Let's take the example of Alice and Bob. 
First, a third party will entangle two qubits using a Hadamard gate and a CX NOT gate. Then one qubit is sent to Alice and the other to Bob 
Alice applies appropriate gates on the qubit depending on what she wants to send and send it to Bob. 
Bob uses his qubit to decode the message using the restoration operation. Then he finally uses Hadamard gate to extract Alice's message. 

    </p>
    <h2>Entanglement</h2>
    <p>
        It is a property of quantum particles where when two entities are entangled, we can say that they are no longer independent, and any changes in one of the entities are reflected in the state of the other entity. This phenomenon is not normal in the classical world.
